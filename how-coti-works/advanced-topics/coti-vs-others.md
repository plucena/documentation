COTI V2, powered by Garbled Circuits (GC), offers unmatched capabilities in privacy-preserving computation, setting a new standard for building multi-party applications like privacy DEXs. Unlike competing technologies such as TEE, ZK-SNARK, MPC, and FHE, Garbled Circuits excel in delivering low-latency performance, compatibility across any device, and resilience through the absence of a single point of failure. With the added advantage of light storage requirements, COTI V2 ensures seamless scalability without compromising efficiency. This cutting-edge approach positions COTI V2 as the leading solution for secure, high-performance applications, driving innovation in privacy-centric blockchain technology.

### Advantages over FHE

COTI simplifies the decryption process and offers a more streamlined approach compared to traditional FHE providers. Unlike asynchronous setups that require multiple steps and callbacks, COTI enables synchronous decryption directly within smart contracts, instantly making results available for conditional checks and seamless contract execution. This simplicity not only enhances efficiency but also reduces development complexity. Furthermore, COTI strengthens privacy by securely re-encrypting decrypted data with the userâ€™s AES key before returning it, eliminating the need for manual access control configurations. By combining ease of use with robust privacy measures, COTI delivers an unparalleled decryption experience for privacy-centric applications.
