# Ethers.js

In order to provide easy access to all the features of COTI, the [**coti-ethers**](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-ethers) JavaScript SDK was created, which is made in a way that has an interface very similar to that of [**Ethers.js**](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/). In fact, ethers is a peer dependency of our library and all of the objects exported by coti-ethers (e.g. Wallet, BrowserProvider, etc.) inherit from the corresponding ethers objects and extend their functionality where needed.

While most of the existing SDKs should work out of the box, using unique COTI features like encrypting transaction inputs, requires executing the onboarding procedure and encrypting using the defined protocol.

The library is made in such a way that after replacing ethers with `coti-ethers` most client apps will work out of box.

## Classes

### BrowserProvider

The `BrowserProvider` class extends the `JsonRpcApiPollingProvider` and provides an interface for interacting with an EIP-1193 compatible browser provider (such as MetaMask). This class enables the sending of JSON-RPC requests to Ethereum nodes via browser extensions and handles account management and signer creation.

```typescript
constructor(ethereum: Eip1193Provider, network?: Networkish, _options?: BrowserProviderOptions)
```

* **Parameters**:
  * `ethereum`: An `Eip1193Provider` (typically a browser extension like MetaMask) that implements the `request` method for sending JSON-RPC requests.
  * `network?`: Optional. A `Networkish` object representing the network configuration (e.g., mainnet, testnet).
  * `_options?`: Optional. `BrowserProviderOptions` that are merged into the `JsonRpcApiProviderOptions` for additional configuration.
* **Description**: Initializes the `BrowserProvider` by setting up the underlying provider and validating the `ethereum` object. It sets the default configuration for handling JSON-RPC requests and provides error handling and debugging features.
* **Throws**:
  * An error if the provided `ethereum` object is not a valid EIP-1193 provider.

```typescript
async function send(method: string, params: Array<any> | Record<string, any>): Promise<any>
```

* **Parameters**:
  * `method`: A string representing the JSON-RPC method (e.g., `eth_accounts`, `eth_sendTransaction`).
  * `params`: An array or object containing the parameters for the JSON-RPC method.
* **Returns**: A `Promise<any>` resolving to the result of the JSON-RPC method.
* **Description**: Sends a JSON-RPC request to the Ethereum provider using the inherited `send` method after initializing the provider via `_start()`.

```typescript
async function _send(payload: JsonRpcPayload | Array<JsonRpcPayload>): Promise<Array<JsonRpcResult | JsonRpcError>>
```

* **Parameters**:
  * `payload`: A `JsonRpcPayload` object or an array of such objects representing the JSON-RPC request(s).
* **Returns**: A `Promise<Array<JsonRpcResult | JsonRpcError>>`, resolving to an array containing the results or errors from the JSON-RPC request.
* **Description**: Sends a single JSON-RPC request using the EIP-1193 protocol. This method does not support batch requests as EIP-1193 does not allow them. If an error occurs, the method returns the error details including the code, message, and data.
* **Throws**: Throws an error if batch requests are attempted.

```typescript
function getRpcError(payload: JsonRpcPayload, error: JsonRpcError): Error
```

* **Parameters**:
  * `payload`: The original JSON-RPC payload that triggered the error.
  * `error`: A `JsonRpcError` object containing error details such as the error code, message, and data.
* **Returns**: An `Error` object with additional information based on the error code.
* **Description**: Enhances the error message based on known EIP-1193 error codes. For example, it rewrites the error message for:
  * `4001`: User denied the request.
  * `4200`: Unsupported request.
* **Example**:
  * `4001` becomes `ethers-user-denied: {message}`
  * `4200` becomes `ethers-unsupported: {message}`

```typescript
function hasSigner(address: number | string): Promise<boolean>
```

* **Parameters**:
  * `address`: A `number` (account index) or `string` (Ethereum address).
* **Returns**: A `Promise<boolean>`, resolving to `true` if the provider manages the given address.
* **Description**: Checks if the provider manages the given account. If an account index is passed, it checks if the account exists at that index. If an address is passed, it verifies whether the address is managed by the provider.

```typescript
async function getSigner(address?: number | string, userOnboardInfo?: OnboardInfo): Promise<JsonRpcSigner>
```

* **Parameters**:
  * `address?`: An optional `number` or `string` representing the account index or Ethereum address. Defaults to the first account if not provided.
  * `userOnboardInfo?`: Optional `OnboardInfo` object containing user-specific data such as AES keys and RSA key pairs for the signer.
* **Returns**: A `Promise<JsonRpcSigner>`, resolving to a custom `JsonRpcSigner` instance associated with the given address.
* **Description**: Retrieves the `JsonRpcSigner` for the specified account. If the provider doesn't manage the specified account, it triggers a request to the Ethereum provider to access accounts (e.g., MetaMask's `eth_requestAccounts` method). After confirming account access, it returns the signer.

### JsonRpcApiProvider

The `JsonRpcApiProvider` class extends the base `JsonRpcApiProvider` from the `ethers.js` library. It adds custom functionality for interacting with JSON-RPC APIs and provides an implementation for retrieving a `JsonRpcSigner`, which includes onboarding user information in the COTI network.

```typescript
constructor(network?: Networkish, options?: JsonRpcApiProviderOptions)
```

* **Parameters**:
  * `network?`: An optional `Networkish` object that specifies the network to connect to.
  * `options?`: Optional configuration options for the JSON-RPC provider (of type `JsonRpcApiProviderOptions`).
* **Description**: Initializes a new instance of the `JsonRpcApiProvider` class. It extends the base provider from `ethers.js`, allowing additional functionality for managing signers and user-specific onboarding.

```typescript
async function getSigner(address?: number | string, userOnboardInfo?: OnboardInfo): Promise<JsonRpcSigner>
```

* **Parameters**:
  * `address?`: An optional `number` or `string` that specifies which account to use. If not provided, defaults to the first account (`0`).
    * If a `number` is provided, it refers to the account index.
    * If a `string` is provided, it refers to an Ethereum address.
  * `userOnboardInfo?`: Optional `OnboardInfo` object that contains user-specific information, such as AES keys, RSA keys, and transaction hashes.
* **Returns**: A `Promise<JsonRpcSigner>`, resolving to a custom `JsonRpcSigner` instance associated with the given account.
* **Description**: This method retrieves a `JsonRpcSigner` instance for the specified account. The method handles two cases:
  1. **Account Index**: If the `address` is a number, the method fetches the list of accounts and returns the signer for the account at that index.
  2. **Account Address**: If the `address` is a string, it checks the list of accounts for the corresponding address and returns the signer for that address.
* **Account Resolution**:
  * The function makes a call to the JSON-RPC API method `eth_accounts` to retrieve the available accounts.
  * The `resolveProperties` utility is used to ensure that both the network and accounts are resolved before the account matching begins.
* **Error Handling**:
  * Throws an error if the specified account index is out of range.
  * Throws an error if the provided address is invalid or not found in the list of accounts.

### JsonRpcSigner

The `JsonRpcSigner` class extends the base `JsonRpcSigner` from `ethers.js` and adds additional functionality for onboarding users and managing encryption using AES keys within the Coti Network. It includes methods for securely encrypting and decrypting data, generating/recovering AES keys, and handling onboarding procedures.

```typescript
constructor(provider: JsonRpcApiProvider, address: string, userOnboardInfo?: OnboardInfo)
```

* **Parameters**:
  * `provider`: An instance of `JsonRpcApiProvider` for interacting with the blockchain.
  * `address`: A string representing the Ethereum address for this signer.
  * `userOnboardInfo?`: Optional `OnboardInfo` object containing user-specific data such as AES keys, RSA keys, and transaction hashes.
* **Description**: Initializes a new instance of the `JsonRpcSigner` class, optionally including user-specific onboarding information. It extends the functionality of the base `JsonRpcSigner` from `ethers` by incorporating encryption-related operations and user onboarding data.

```typescript
async function encryptValue(plaintextValue: bigint | number | string, contractAddress: string, functionSelector: string): Promise<itUint | itString>
```

* **Parameters**:
  * `plaintextValue`: The value to encrypt, which can be of type `bigint`, `number`, or `string`.
  * `contractAddress`: The smart contract address to which the encryption is related.
  * `functionSelector`: The function identifier for the contract interaction.
* **Returns**: A `Promise<itUint | itString>`, depending on the type of the plaintext value.
* **Description**: Encrypts the provided plaintext using the user’s AES key. If the AES key is not available, it attempts to generate or recover it via onboarding. The function handles both integer and string values and returns the encrypted result accordingly.

```typescript
async function decryptValue(ciphertext: ctUint | ctString): Promise<bigint | string>
```

* **Parameters**:
  * `ciphertext`: The encrypted value, which can either be of type `ctUint` (for integers) or `ctString` (for strings).
* **Returns**: A `Promise<bigint | string>`, depending on the ciphertext type.
* **Description**: Decrypts the provided ciphertext using the AES key stored in the user’s onboarding information. If the AES key is missing, it attempts to onboard the user or recover the key. The method supports decryption for both integers and strings.

```typescript
async function generateOrRecoverAes(onboardContractAddress: string = ONBOARD_CONTRACT_ADDRESS): Promise<void>
```

* **Parameters**:
  * `onboardContractAddress`: The contract address used for onboarding purposes. Defaults to `ONBOARD_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.
* **Returns**: A `Promise<void>`.
* **Description**: This function attempts to generate or recover the user's AES key. If the AES key already exists in the onboarding information, it returns immediately. If the user’s RSA key and transaction hash are available, the AES key is recovered from the blockchain using the `recoverAesFromTx` function. If no onboarding info exists, it checks the user's account balance and initiates the onboarding process if the balance is sufficient.
* **Error Handling**:
  * Throws an error if the user's account balance is `0`, preventing onboarding.

### Wallet

The `Wallet` class extends the base `Wallet` from the `ethers` library, adding features specific to the COTI network. It handles user onboarding, key management, and encryption/decryption of values using AES and RSA keys. The class also supports the process of automatically onboarding users if needed.

```typescript
constructor(privateKey: string | SigningKey, provider?: Provider | null, userOnboardInfo?: OnboardInfo)
```

* **Parameters**:
  * `privateKey`: A `string` or `SigningKey` used to initialize the wallet.
  * `provider?`: An optional `Provider` object or `null`. Defaults to `null` if not provided.
  * `userOnboardInfo?`: An optional `OnboardInfo` object that contains the user's onboarding data (e.g., AES key, RSA key).
* **Description**: Initializes a new `Wallet` instance with a given private key, provider, and optional user onboarding information. This class extends the `BaseWallet` from the `ethers` library, inheriting its functionality.
