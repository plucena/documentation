# Account Onboarding Procedure

Account Onboarding is a procedure that is needed to acquire the EOA unique AES key, which is needed when the wallet wishes to perform GC related on-chain computation operations; that is when the AES key is being used (e.g. encryption and decryption).

Once the EOA is created and funded with native coin, it needs to be onboarded to the system to obtain an AES key.&#x20;

See the [guide for onboarding an account](../guides/account-onboard.md).

After completing the Account Onboard step the wallet has a functional account with the necessary credentials (having own AES key) allowing it to start interacting with the gcEVM operations, including running smart contracts or performing other actions as needed.

You can fund accounts using the COTI [faucet.md](../../networks/faucet.md "mention").
