# v1.1.4

**Release Notes v1.1.4**

Changes from v1.1.3 (Post-Audit Improvements)\
Following an in-depth security audit, version 1.1.4 of both MPC and gcEVM introduces key\
fixes and refinements focused on stability, security, and maintainability. These updates reflect\
our ongoing commitment to delivering a robust, privacy-preserving infrastructure.

**MPC – Key Fixes & Improvements**

1. Strengthened File Handling Logic   \
   Improved file path validation to prevent unintended access outside approved directories,   \
   reducing the risk of directory traversal vulnerabilities.
2. Improved Randomness Validation   \
   Enforced minimum entropy checks for random seeds used in cryptographic functions,   \
   aligning with recommended security practices.
3. Refined Random Byte Generation   \
   Updated internal methods for device-level randomness to ensure consistency and   \
   improve cryptographic unpredictability.
4. More Resilient Connection Handling   \
   Fixed a race condition in client connection logic, improving reliability under high   \
   concurrency or unexpected delays.
5. Enhanced Cleanup of Sensitive Data   \
   Ensured secure memory wiping in destructors to better protect in-memory secrets from   \
   residual access.
6. Introduced a Unique Fixed Key per Garbled Circuit   \
   Enhanced cryptographic security by generating a fresh fixed key for each garbled circuit   \
   instance, replacing the previous static approach and reducing key reuse.
7. Improved Memory Management in Garbling Workflow   \
   Fixed allocation and cleanup routines within the batch garbling process, preventing   \
   memory leaks and improving runtime stability.
8. Safer Arithmetic Operations   \
   Introduced checks to prevent potential integer overflows and underflows during circuit   \
   construction and evaluation.
9. Better Exception Safety   \
   Strengthened error-handling in destructors and allocation logic to avoid crashes during   \
   failure scenarios.
10. Hardened Input Validation Across Modules    \
    Applied more robust input validation throughout the codebase, reducing attack surface    \
    from malformed or unexpected inputs.

**gcEVM – Key Fixes & Improvements**

1. Improved Transcript Validation   \
   Strengthened the validation of MPC transcript hash to ensure correctness in secure   \
   execution. This fix led to the introduction of the network’s first protocol fork, Hydrogen,   \
   aligning all nodes with the corrected logic.
2. Fixed gRPC Error Handling in Opcode Execution   \
   Improved handling of unexpected or unmapped gRPC errors in the opcode execution   \
   path to reduce the likelihood of silent failures during MPC interactions.
3. Fixed Redundant Verification in Block Insertion   \
   Simplified block processing by removing duplicate verification steps, resulting in a more   \
   maintainable and efficient flow.
4. Fixed Minor Issues in Authenticated Memory Handling   \
   Corrected subtle inconsistencies between the authenticated memory implementation   \
   and its documentation.
